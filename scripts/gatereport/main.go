// Command gatereport runs every acceptance gate this repository defines and
// prints one line per gate.
//
// Why it exists. The plan's acceptance line is a list of make targets, and
// until now the only way to answer "are they green?" was to type them one at
// a time. That was done by hand for a full sweep (decision 462) and the
// result was seven red out of thirty-three — of which two were real defects
// and three were the machine's own state. Sorting that out by hand is
// legitimate work; doing it by hand is the problem, because nobody else can
// repeat it and a sweep nobody can repeat is a fact with no owner.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do:
//
//   - It stores nothing. No file, no score, no summary that a reader could
//     quote tomorrow. The output is today's answer, and a stored version of
//     it would be exactly the disease decision 462 spent a knife on: a
//     number in a document that nothing recomputes. If this command wrote
//     its result anywhere, its result would be wrong the next time a gate
//     changed and nobody looked.
//
//   - It does not decide whether a red gate is the tree's fault. That
//     judgement needs the gate's own output and the machine it ran on, and
//     a tool that guessed would be a tool that launders a missing MySQL
//     into "the repository is broken". It prints the command, the outcome,
//     and the tail of whatever the gate said, and stops.
//
//   - It does not run the gates that cigate records as not run, and it says
//     so by name rather than skipping them silently.
//
// The timeout is per gate and generous, because one slow gate must not
// consume the budget of the rest; a gate that exceeds it is reported as
// TIMEOUT, which is a fact about the run rather than a verdict about the
// repository.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go run ./scripts/gatereport [-timeout 20m] [repo-root]
//
// Exit 0 — every runnable gate passed, and any gate that did not run has a
// recorded reason.
// Exit 1 — at least one gate failed or timed out.
