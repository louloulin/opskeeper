// Command audit is the completion audit: which open items this repository can
// decide, and which ones it cannot.
//
// The problem it answers is one the ledger made visible. After the diagnosis
// axis reached 20/20, the remaining open items stopped being the same KIND
// of thing as the ones that came before. Most of the last ones needed a
// capability. What is left mostly needs evidence this repository cannot
// produce — a real provider key, a real Docker daemon, a real broker — and
// those were being carried in prose, where they look exactly like the
// capability items did.
//
// So every open item is declared here with a class:
//
//	repo      — this repository can decide it, right now, with a command.
//	external  — the deciding evidence lives outside this tree. Declared with
//	            what that evidence is and who holds it, so "we could not test
//	            it" stops being a shrug.
//	judgment  — a claim that is a decision, not a measurement. Never counted
//	            as closed by a machine, because a machine counting its own
//	            author would be the one thing an audit cannot be.
//
// The score is repo items closed over repo items. External items are printed,
// never scored: scoring them zero would say the platform is 90% done, and
// scoring them full would say the audit passed. Neither is true.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go run ./scripts/audit [repo-root]
