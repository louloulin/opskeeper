// The catalog index and the compatibility matrix.
//
// LoadCatalog has existed since the manifest loader did, and until this
// file it had no production caller: the control plane could validate a
// catalog and then had nothing to show it. An index that only tests can
// reach is a class in a library, and an operator asking "what can this fleet
// install" was answered by reading YAML.
//
// Two questions, kept apart because they have different answers:
//
//   - the INDEX: what is on offer. Name, version, targets, safety tier,
//     capabilities, scopes, tool count, install policy.
//   - the MATRIX: for a given node build, what can be installed HERE. The
//     same package is installable on one fleet and refused on another, and
//     the refusal names the component to upgrade.
//
// The matrix is computed with CheckVersions — the same function the node's
// own admission calls. Computing it here with a second implementation
// would make the control plane's pre-flight and the node's refusal able to
// disagree, which is the failure versionmatrix_test.go exists to prevent.

// Origin names where a row of the index came from.
//
// The index used to read exactly one directory, which was honest about what
// it did and wrong about what it claimed: the route is "the packages this
// tenant can install", and a multi-tenant deployment has more than one
// directory a package can be installed from. A package sitting in the
// cluster-wide root is installable by every tenant and was invisible to
// every one of them.
//
// The label is per root, not per package, because that is the fact an
// operator acts on: "which of these came from the cluster root" is a
// question about the fleet, and it is the question that decides whether
// uninstalling a row means anything to anybody else.
const (
	// OriginTenant is the caller's own install root.
	OriginTenant = "tenant"
	// OriginSystem is the cluster-wide root every tenant sees.
	OriginSystem = "system"
	// OriginBuiltin is an image-baked root, read-only by construction:
	// nothing installs into it and nothing uninstalls from it.
	OriginBuiltin = "builtin"
)

// Root is one directory the index reads.
//
// Precedence is explicit rather than implied by argument order, because the
// answer to "a package by this name is in both roots" is a product decision
// (the tenant's copy is the one that runs) and a decision that depends on
// the order a caller happened to pass its arguments is a decision nobody
// wrote down.

	// Path is the directory to read. Empty or absent is skipped, so a
	// deployment that configures no builtin roots does not have to filter
	// them out itself.
	Path string
	// Label is the Origin constant this root contributes.
	Label string
}

// Entry is one row of the index.
//
// The compatibility question — can THIS node host that package — is not
// answered here. It is answered by core/domains/service/plugin, which
// projects the decision across the real fleet and is what a release is
// gated on. This file answers the quieter question: what is on offer, and
// what does each package say about itself.
//
// That separation was measured rather than preferred. The first version of
// this file also built a grid over hypothetical (edge, pig) pairs, and it
// was a worse answer to a question the control plane already answers per
// node — a fleet's actual versions beat a grid of versions an operator
// invented to look at. The grid is gone; what stays is the index.

	// acted on: "3 of 40 rows shadow something" does not say which 3.

	// MinEdgeVersion and MinPigVersion are the two host floors. Empty is
	// "did not say", which the domain layer reads as no requirement — so
