// Rebalance history is the one thing a Kafka client cannot be asked for.
//
// DescribeGroups answers a question about NOW: who is in the group right now,
// what state it is in, which member holds which partitions. There is no admin
// API that returns what the assignment used to be, so "what happened to this
// group last Tuesday" has no endpoint — it has to be built from successive
// answers, and a tool that printed today's assignment under the name
// "rebalance history" would be answering a different question than it was
// asked. That is why the name was left unimplemented for so long, and why
// closing it meant writing a collector rather than adding a tool.
//
// The file is split so the part worth trusting is pure:
//
//   - MemberState / GroupState and their Fingerprint: what "the group looks
//     like at an instant" means, canonically. Maps are sorted before hashing
//     because two identical assignments that happen to iterate differently
//     are the same assignment, and a history that reported a rebalance every
//     sample because of map ordering would be worse than no history.
//   - diffGroups: what changed between two instants. Joined, left, reassigned
//     and the state transition — the four things a person asking "did it
//     rebalance" is actually asking.
//   - RebalanceHistory: a bounded store. Bounded on purpose: an unbounded
//     history of a busy group is a disk incident, and a rebalance history
//     nobody prunes is a rebalance history that eventually takes the control
//     plane down.
//
// What fills the store, and when, is decided by the caller rather than here,
// because only the caller knows whether a read is worth a sample. The
// contract this package relies on is narrower and it is worth stating: an
// absent sample is never invented. A query over a window OpsKeeper was not
// watching returns the window it did watch, and says so.

// MemberState is one member of a consumer group as of one sample.

// depended on Go's map iteration order would make every sample look like a
// change and turn the history into noise. It is a string rather than a hash
// so that a fingerprint can be printed in an event and compared by a human
